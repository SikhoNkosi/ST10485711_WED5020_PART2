Overview
In CSS FILE, I focused on creating a clean, modern, and responsive design for the Spar website. I started by setting a consistent font family across all pages to improve readability, and applied font sizes, line height, and font weight to make the text visually balanced. I used margin and padding to space out elements properly, ensuring the layout feels open and easy to navigate. For color, I chose a green-themed palette to match Sparâ€™s branding, styling the navigation bar, buttons, and footer with complementary shades. I also added hover effects to links and buttons for interactivity. Flexbox was used to center and space out the navigation links, making the site responsive on different screen sizes. Images were styled with rounded corners and shadows to give them a polished look, and forms were designed with clean input fields and buttons to make user interaction smooth. Overall, the CSS brings structure, style, and usability to the website.
